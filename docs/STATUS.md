# Implementation status and session handoff

Updated: 2026-10-05 (Asia/Kolkata). Stage: P01 runnable foundation complete.
Public API and frontend run; application schema and transactional workflows remain unfinished.

Publication authorization: on 2026-10-05 the user explicitly approved pushing the
complete handoff to GitHub, including the original PDF, extracted brief, student
names and registration numbers. The earlier publication approval block is resolved.
Local setup is complete; the repository handoff is intended for GitHub publication.

## Completed initialization

- Cloned the initially empty `ryanfer123/DBTHON-26` repository into this workspace.
- Preserved the exact original 16-page PDF, full extraction and three diagram pages
  with a SHA-256 manifest.
- Prepared contributor instructions, source context, requirements/traceability,
  architecture/ADR, schema and domain specifications, API/UX, implementation tasks,
  validation plan, demo script and all eight course-deliverable templates.
- Prepared fictional four-zone demo fixtures with relative timestamps, retry history,
  capacity edge cases and independently reconcilable baseline impact expectations.
- Added PostgreSQL/PostGIS Compose configuration, ignored local environment template,
  development notes, PR/task templates and handoff-check CI configuration.

## Verification record

Observed initialization checks:

| Command / check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 scripts/validate_handoff.py` | PASS: source hashes and 16-page extraction, relative links, FR01-FR10/NFR01-NFR06 coverage, P01-P12/T01-T12, eight deliverables, fixture constraints and hand-computed totals |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=compose-validation-placeholder docker compose config --quiet` | PASS: Compose configuration parses with a throwaway validation value; no service started |
| Original PDF vs repository PDF SHA-256 | Identical; complete byte-for-byte source preserved |

The original handoff checks used Python 3.14.7. Subsequent application checks and
Docker startup are recorded below; no notification or pilot results are claimed.

## P01 implementation and observed checks

- API factory, configuration/pooling, public community response, liveness and real
  PostGIS readiness, safe failure responses and request IDs.
- React welcome screen and accessible role tabs backed by the API, deep-link refresh,
  error/retry, mobile layout and selected design reference in docs/design.
- Committed Python/npm lockfiles, dev/setup/export scripts, Make commands and API/web/
  browser CI configuration. Local `.env` is ignored and credentials are not printed.
- Local versions: Python 3.13.15, Node 22.19.0, PostgreSQL 17.5, PostGIS 3.5.

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| pytest | 6 passed, including truthful readiness and redacted connection failure |
| Ruff / strict mypy | Passed; no backend lint/type errors |
| ESLint / TypeScript | Passed |
| Vitest | 4 passed: role/keyboard navigation, direct route, offline retry, missing route |
| Vite production build | Passed |
| Playwright desktop/mobile | 4 passed against live API and PostgreSQL/PostGIS |
| Native 1505x1045 + mobile 390x844 screenshot/console inspection | Meaningful content, no framework overlay, no app warnings/errors, no horizontal overflow |
| Live health checks | `alive` and `ready`; PostgreSQL/PostGIS versions queried directly |

Visual comparison used `view_image` on both the retained concept and browser render.
Inspected white/forest/sage palette, header, two-line heading, timeline positions,
CTA, tabs, community band and footer. Fixed initial heading wrap, column width,
CTA size and vertical spacing. Copy above the fold matches the concept. Intentional
extensions: route-backed receiver/volunteer descriptions, loading/error/retry states,
and mobile stacking. Browser plugin absent; used Playwright with installed Chrome.
Current tests are foundation evidence, not T01-T12 domain completion or TRL validation.
Remote CI configuration exists; a passing hosted run has not been verified.

## Next work

**P02 is the first unfinished task:** versioned schema, constraints/indexes, guarded
SQL routines, runtime roles/RLS, immutable trust events and repeatable fixture seeding.
The local PostGIS service runs; no owner decision blocks database implementation.
Follow with P03 authentication and verified role/zone access.
Use [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) as the handoff prompt.

## Outstanding decisions / evidence

Implementation choices needed for the prototype are resolved in ADR 0001. No owner
input blocks P01. Real donor/NGO interviews, a pilot, source-statistic verification,
an emissions factor and an external notification channel are not supplied. License
selection and production deployment are later owner decisions. Initial repository
setup does not authorize paid deployment or contacting participants.

## Session update format for future contributors

Record date/commit, completed plan gates, changed modules/migration IDs, exact commands
and outcomes, partial requirements/known failures, and the next concrete task. Keep
requirements.json statuses and implementation-plan checkboxes aligned with evidence.
